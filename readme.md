JustForFun Role Play
====================

A just cause 2 plugin.

I'm creating this plugin in my free time, for free. You are free to copy the script aslong you give me the credits.
Currently this plugin is heavely under development and i'm still learning how everything works.

Features
--------

* A vehicle fuel system, depending on how fast you drive your fuel gets used (second bar under speed).
In the future I want to count in damage, car type for example a plane uses alot more then a normal car.

* Saving player location on disconnect in mysql. 
In the future there gets stored more in the database. Now it are just the X Y Z coordinates.

* Your coordinates on the maps gets shown under the nav bar.
In the future only admins stuff with enable disable.

* Top Banners.
Not sure if i'm going to keep those.

In The plannings
----------------

* Save cars in mysql, find some way to sell cars ingame to player for example at a car shop, or some big fuel stations.
* A job system, get a job to earn money! For exmaple: Deliver packages, Taxi driver for other players, Some other things?
* ... feel free to suggest stuff!
